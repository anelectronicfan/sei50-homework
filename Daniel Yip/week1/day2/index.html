    <h1>The Calculator</h1>
    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and **return** the result. <br>It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."</li>
        <br>
        <li>Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and **return** the result. <br>It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".</li>
        <br>
        <li>Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and **return** the result. <br>It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."</li>
        <br>
        <li>Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and **return** the result. <br>It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <ol>
        <p>Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the flilowing operations, using the functions you wrote earlier:</p>
        <li>Take half of the number and store the result.</li><br>
        <li>Square the result of #1 and store that result.</li><br>
        <li>Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.</li><br>
        <li>Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).</li><br>
    </ol>  

    <h1>Strings</h1>
    <h2>DrEvil</h2>
    <p>Create a function called DrEvil.<br>
        It should take a single argument, an amount, and return 'amount dollars', except it will add '(pinky)' at the end if the amount is 1 million.</p>
    <h2>MixUp</h2>
    <p>Create a function called mixUp.<br>
        It should take in two strings, and return the concatenation of the two strings (separated by a space) slicing out and swapping the first 2 characters of each.<br>
        You can assume that the strings are at least 2 characters long.</p>
    <h2>FixStart</h2>
    <p>Create a function called fixStart.<br>
        It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurences of its first character have been replaced with '*', except for the first character itself.<br>
        You can assume that the string is at least one character long.</p>
    <h2>Verbing</h2>
    <p>Create a function called verbing.<br>
        It should take a single argument, a string. If its length is at least 3, it should add 'ing' to its end, unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case it should add 'ly' instead.<br>
        If the string length is less than 3, it should leave it unchanged.</p>
    <h2>Not Bad</h2>
    <p>Create a function called notBad that takes a single argument, a string.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It should find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'bad'.</li>
        <li>If the 'bad' follows the 'not', then it should replace the whole 'not'...'bad' substring with 'good' and return the result.</li>
        <li>If it doesn't find 'not' and 'bad' in the right sequence (or at all), just return the original sentence.</li>
    </ul>
